At some point in history, illustrations were cut from the pages of Manuscript 5 of the Municipal Library of Châteauroux and sold. Today, the manuscript is held in the collections of the Bibliothèque virtuelle des manuscrits médiévaux, and the missing illustrations are held in the collection of the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Both institutions make their collections openly available via IIIF, allowing Biblissima to digitally reunite the missing illustrations with their pages so researchers can view them as intended.'

In this example, photographs made available via IIIF from the Smithsonian Institute Archives and National Portrait Gallery (US) are assembled in a <a href="https://projectmirador.org/">Mirador</a> viewer to show documenation of physicist Chien-Shiung Wu at work alongside non-IIIF videos about her career and a timeline of her career from other sites. Each resource links back to its source repository, providing opportunities for further exploration.'

In this example, annotation text guides the viewer through IIIF-enabled images from the collection at St Andrews which depict Edweard Muybridge’s accidental creation of the first motion picture. While the tool was developed for faculty at the University to use in teaching, it is openly available to users anywhere and works with any IIIF-enabled resource that makes a Manifest file openly available.'
