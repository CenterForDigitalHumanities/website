      caption: "At some point in history, illustrations were cut from the pages of Manuscript 5 of the Municipal Library of Châteauroux and sold. Today, the manuscript is held in the digital collections of the Bibliothèque virtuelle des manuscrits médiévaux, and the missing illustrations are held in the collection of the Bibliothèque nationale de France. Both institutions make their collections openly available via IIIF, allowing Biblissima, a portal for manuscript research, to digitally reunite the missing illustrations with their pages so researchers can view them as intended."

Here, the Mirador viewer displays an image of a cell with IIIF annotations showing its parts, allowing students to zoom in and out to see the relative size of each of the parts compared to the whole of the cell. Each course session focuses on different cell parts, and the viewer brings students to the corresponding area of the image when students view the session pages."

It allows users to easily develop guided annotation experiences for individual or grouped IIIF resources. In this example, annotations guide the viewer through images illustrating Edweard Muybridge’s accidental creation of the first motion picture in the 1880’s. While the tool was developed for faculty at the University to use in teaching, they have made the tool openly available, and it works with any IIIF-enabled resource that makes a Manifest file openly available."
