## Executive Committee election results

Voting has recently closed for two available seats on the IIIF Executive Committee.
The members of the IIIF Consortium selected Getty and Europeana to remain on the
committee for a period of three years. We thank the institutional members the
Consortium who voted in this election.

In the fourth quarter of 2021, a call for nominations will be released for the
11 seats on the committee that will open for elections at that time. Current
Committee members may stand for reelection, and other full IIIF Consortium members
may also stand for election to the committee.
