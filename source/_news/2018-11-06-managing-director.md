We are pleased to announce that Josh Hadro will be the IIIF Managing Director, effective 26 November 2018. In this role, Josh will coordinate the growing activities of IIIF, manage the business affairs of the IIIF Consortium, and cultivate a broader, stronger and more diverse network of IIIF contributors and beneficiaries.  

Josh Hadro comes from the New York Public Library, where he is currently the Associate Director for Digital Policy; he previously worked as the Deputy Director for NYPL Labs, where he managed a staff of 21, and helped oversee their operations from digitization to innovative dissemination of digital assets in ground-breaking ways. Prior to that, Josh served as the Executive Editor at Library Journal, where he directed news and feature operations, and had budgeting and business development responsibilities. During his tenure at LJ, he experienced firsthand the digital disruption to the news industry.

The Search Committee found Josh’s experience and skills to be a great match for IIIF. Emmanuelle Bermès (Bibliothèque nationale de France), co-chair of the Search Committee, summarized the group’s impression: _“We were impressed by his combination of strategic and technical strengths. Though he has not been directly involved in IIIF until now, he brings a clear vision for what it may become, and how to get there.”_

Emmanuelle Delmas-Glass (Yale Center for British Art), also co-chair of the Search Committee, added: _“He showed attention to fairness, transparency, and diversity--all core values of the IIIF community, and critical to its ongoing success.”_

Josh will be attending the IIIF Working Group meeting in [Edinburgh][edinburgh] from 3-6 December 2018, and looks forward to meeting many in the community there.

Please join us in welcoming Josh Hadro to IIIF as we work together to help IIIF grow and thrive.
