# Call for proposals now open: 2022 IIIF Annual Conference


The [2022 International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF) Annual Conference](https://iiif.io/event/2022/cambridge/) will be held in-person in Cambridge, MA (USA) June 6-8. The conference will be co-hosted by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).   

**Submissions are due by February 18, 2022**

### Submissions

Please submit proposals through Conftool (you will need to register for an account): [https://www.conftool.org/iiif2022](https://www.conftool.org/iiif2022)

### Format
The Program Committee are looking for proposals in the following forms:

- Lightning talks (6 minutes)
- 20 minute presentations (plus additional 10 minutes for questions)
- 90 minute panel discussion (please see note below)
- Online workshop (to be held the week before or after the in-person event, up to 4 hours)   

Note: only panel sessions that have a diverse set of panelists will be considered, with representation along many possible dimensions, including but not limited to race and ethnicity, national origin, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, age, and socio-economic status. Similarly, representation from a variety of geographic regions or institution types and sizes will be prioritized.   

For those submitting in multiple format categories, we’ll be limiting the number of times any individual may present to a maximum of two sessions of any kind (excluding official IIIF business like TSG chair presentations or similar).   

All submitted proposals are peer-reviewed and will be considered for inclusion in the conference schedule by a volunteer program committee. Presenters are expected to register and attend in person. Final versions of the accepted abstracts and presentations will be made openly available after the conference.   

### Proposal themes
We encourage showcasing developments in IIIF and in particular would welcome presentations in the following areas:

- IIIF implementation spectrum: large-scale or small-scale projects
- Interoperability in IIIF contexts and beyond
