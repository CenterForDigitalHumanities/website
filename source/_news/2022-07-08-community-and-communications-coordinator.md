## Description
The International Image Interoperability Framework  (IIIF) Consortium is seeking a Community and Communications Coordinator to complement the Managing Director and Technical Coordinator roles to help bring IIIF to new sectors and adopters while maintaining a vibrant, positive and creative community advancing access to high quality digital resources.

The person in this role will serve as a coordinator, communicator, and facilitator, working with the experts and adopters of IIIF to help advance the framework and its utility. The role will work closely with the Managing Director and Technical Coordinator to align efforts, and will also liaise with IIIF editorial, community, and technical groups to ensure consistency and continuous improvement. Meanwhile, given that IIIF events are a primary means for coordinating community activities and updates, the Community and Communications Coordinator will serve a key role in supervising the organization and support of IIIF events, in-person and online. 

## About the IIIF Consortium and Community

IIIF is a community-driven technology led by world-leading research, national and state libraries, archives, museums, companies and image repositories committed to providing access to high quality digital resources. 

IIIF is at an exciting phase in its evolution: the IIIF Consortium (IIIF-C) is growing, and the IIIF specifications have expanded to include audio and video, while new specifications related to 3D materials are in the works. Eleven years ago, IIIF started out as a loose agreement among a handful of institutions to work together but now has a dedicated staff, thousands of project adoptions worldwide, and image servers delivering more than one billion IIIF-compliant resources. 

The IIIF Consortium has a staff of three including this role, a Technical Coordinator (based in Wales), and a Managing Director (based in New York City, NY). We use Slack, Zoom, the Google Suite, HubSpot, Mailchimp, and a variety of other tools to keep in touch with the broader IIIF Community. The Consortium is governed by an Executive Committee of representatives from 13 member institutions and an Operating Committee that meets monthly, and is advised by a Coordinating Committee that includes representatives from all facets of the IIIF community. 

The IIIF Consortium is an affiliate of the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR), which serves as its fiscal host. This position will be organizationally based at CLIR.

- Communication support, including website updates, newsletters, social media, etc.

## Relevant Skills & Experience
