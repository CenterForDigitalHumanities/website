Finally, as departing and original chairperson of the IIIF-C, the following members of the Operating Committee for the past 6 years have been marvelous counselors and advisors on the many issues, large and small, that have been dealt with smoothly and professionally, always with the needs and desires of the larger IIIF community in mind, including recruiting a well-functioning staff of Josh Hadro (managing director), Glen Robson (technical coordinator), and Meg O’Hearn (community and events coordinator):

- Rich Fagen (Getty) vice-chairperson
- Adam Farquhar (British Library) treasurer
- Klaus Ceynowa (Bayerishe Staatsbibliothek)
- Emmanuelle Bermès (Bibliothèque national de France)
- Emmanuelle Delmas-Glass (Yale)
- Neil Fitzgerald (British Library) treasurer
- Tom Cramer as advisor (Stanford) 

These volunteers deserve a round of thanks for their long term commitment to looking after the various non-profit business affairs and interests of the International Image Interoperability Framework over the past 6 years. For all of us, myself included, helping to advance the cause of the IIIF for its mission has been satisfying, an honor, and a privilege. Long may IIIF advance for the benefit of all web denizens.
