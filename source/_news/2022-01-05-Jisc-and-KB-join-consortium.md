We are happy to announce that for the start of the new year [Jisc](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/) and [The National Library of the Netherlands / Koninklijke Bibliotheek (KB)](https://www.kb.nl/) have joined the [IIIF Consortium]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/community/consortium/), as full member and associate member respectively.

Jisc is a UK nonprofit that provides "relevant and useful advice, digital content and network and IT services, while we research and develop new technologies and ways of working." Of particular interest to the IIIF Community is the Archives Hub program, which "brings together descriptions of thousands of the UKâ€™s archive collections," and which is undertaking IIIF implementation initiatives this coming year.

The KB was founded in 1798 and collects books, newspapers, magazines and maps related to the Netherlands. The KB have recently started implementing IIIF in their infrastructure and are working on integrating the APIs into their future digital endeavors.
