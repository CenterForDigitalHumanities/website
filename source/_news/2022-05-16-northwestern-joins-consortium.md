We are happy to announce that [Northwestern University Libraries](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/) have joined the IIIF Consortium as a full member, along with the [University of British Columbia (UBC) Library](https://www.library.ubc.ca/) and DB Ecosensystem joining as associate members. This bring the total number of [consortium members][members] to 63.

The Northwestern University Libraries serve over 1 million visitors annually,  with collections featuring some 6.2 million titles and hundreds of thousands of digitized special and archival works. The [Digital Collections](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/libraries-collections/digital-collections/index.html) use IIIF to serve up these high-resolution digital images from Northwestern’s collection, including posters, manuscripts, photographs, letters, and maps, as well as audio-visual content such as the Northwestern University Football Films and Master Class audio recordings. 

Joining the IIIF Consortium is an important means of supporting the Libraries' strategic initiatives, and adds to [their longstanding committments in the space](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/about/administration/consortia-and-memberships.html) along with their support of the Samvera and other open source communities. Northwestern has been publishing IIIF manifests for years via their [digital collections](https://digitalcollections.library.northwestern.edu/) and are very active in terms of developing IIIF-compliant components, including the popular [Serverless IIIF application](https://github.com/samvera-labs/serverless-iiif), a node [IIIF image processor](https://github.com/samvera-labs/node-iiif), and other components for creating IIIF display elements like [Clover](https://samvera-labs.github.io/clover-iiif/) and [Bloom](https://samvera-labs.github.io/bloom-iiif/).

With more than nine million volumes in print and electronic formats, the UBC Library is a vital support for research, learning and teaching excellence at UBC. The Library's [Open Collections](https://open.library.ubc.ca/) include more than 260,000 digital photos, books, newspapers, maps, videos, theses and more, using IIIF for digital asset delivery. These publicly-accessible collections are constantly growing and reflect the research interests of the UBC community and beyond, and are powered by the [Open Collections Research API](https://open.library.ubc.ca/docs) which also provides programmatic access to IIIF images and manifests.

DB Ecosensystem is an innovative startup based in Italy committed to scientific research activities. The company’s focus is on discovering advanced procedures to integrate 3D models and 2D/IIIF standards and on the developing of a 3D/IIIF application to cultural estate assets. The system will perform a smart acquisition of the structures in 3D models associating a set of digital data to be implemented in comparative analysis methodologies with subsequent time scans. Another important implementation in the project is the creation of an innovative interoperation among 3D, IIIF, and FITS format allowing semi-automated data acquisition and long-term preservation of 3D models.
