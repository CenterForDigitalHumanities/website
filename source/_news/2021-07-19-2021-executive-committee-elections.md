All [full members of the IIIF Consortium]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/community/consortium/members/) are eligible to stand in the October 2021 elections for one of 11 Executive Committee seats. Please send nominations, including self-nominations, to [Josh Hadro, managing director of the IIIF Consortium](mailto:josh.hadro@iiif.io) and [Michael A. Keller, chair of the IIIF Consortium and its Executive Committee](mailto:makeller@stanford.edu ) by 15 September 2021.

## Background
Under the terms of our ["Next Steps"]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/community/consortium/next_steps/ ), agreed on in April 2018, 11 of 13 members of the Executive Committee have expiring terms this year. IIIF-C will conduct an election in October 2021 to elect 11 institutions to the Executive Committee for one-, two-, or three-year terms, from among the full membership of the consortium. 

All members of the IIIF Executive Committee are eligible to stand for re-election. The J. Paul Getty Trust and Europeana were re-elected last year, and will continue to serve on the Executive Committee for two more years.

Among the 11 elected institutions, those getting the four highest votes in October will serve three-year terms. Those institutions getting the next three highest votes will serve two-year terms. Those institutions getting the four least votes will serve a one-year term. In this way, staggered terms will result and all elections following would be for three year terms. Please see the table that follows the schedule of elections in the coming years.

The election will be held in October of 2021 and each October for the succeeding years. Elected institutions will take their seats on 1 January of the year following the election.

As we enter this most significant election, the IIIF Consortium wishes to offer praise for and admiration of the institutions and their representatives on the Executive Committee over these past years. These are:

- Bayerisches Staatsbibliothek (Klaus Ceynowa, Markus Brantl)
- Bibliothèque nationale de France (Arnaud Beaufort and Emmanuelle Bermès*)
