This year the week of March 15th, the dreaded Ides of March, premonates great news for the IIIF Community. On March 13, 14 and 15, three separate community outreach workshops will occur in Dublin, Boston and Paris. Initiated and organized by IIIF institutions, these three workshops will offer different communities the opportunity to get hands-on and learn about the added value that IIIF can provide the academic and heritage sectors. All events are free.

## Ireland

On March 13, Digital Repository of Ireland, UCD Library, and DARIAH Ireland are hosting a IIIF Showcase and Workshop event in the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin. This event, which has a few spaces left, will introduce attendees to IIIF and its committed community and offer use case showcases from several Irish institutions including Digital Repository of Ireland, University College Dublin, and the National University of Ireland Galway.

## New England

On March 14-15, IIIF-C members Harvard and MIT are facilitating a two one-day events for the  IIIF New England group at Harvard. March 14 will be a showcase and informative meeting covering topics such as,

 * What is IIIF and why should I care?
 * Showcases from local institutions
 * Forthcoming developments to IIIF
 * Options for implementing IIIF

The March 15 meeting will be a day of technical discussions for developers and implementers, in an unconference format. You must register for the two events separately.

## Paris

On March 15, the Biblissima project is convening the first IIIF outreach event in Paris. This half-day event will include a broad overview of IIIF, followed by a series of lightning talks showcasing various implementations in different contexts. The event will occur in French and provide an enlightening and inspiring introduction as IIIF spreads its wings across France. Speakers and use cases will be given by French institutions already using IIIF including the National Library of France, Le Louvre, Institut de recherche et d'histoire des textes and more.
