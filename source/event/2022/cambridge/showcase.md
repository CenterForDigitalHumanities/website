### Who is it for?

The IIIF Showcase is an event for people new to IIIF to get an overview and discover the latest developments in a single event (though it offers something for everyone, so returning attendees are welcome as well!). It assumes no previous experience with IIIF and will cover the full gamut of IIIF from the basics to Showcases of the latest developments in the IIIF Community. 

### What will I learn?

* Use cases and best practices from IIIF adopters
* How to get started with IIIF at your institution
* Leveraging open source software to get more out of your collection of images and video
* The latest developments in the community including IIIF A/V and 3D
* Cutting-edge use cases including applications of AI/Machine Learning
* And more!
