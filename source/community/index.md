Overall, we think there are [hundreds of adopters]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/community/map) of IIIF all around the world, at libraries, museums, archives, universities, and some companies, too.

There are lots of ways to get involved and join the conversation!

## Community and Technical Specification Groups
IIIF Groups meet regularly to discuss various contexts of IIIF usage for a particular idea or initiative. View a full list of active and completed croups along with their charters, chairs, and meeting times [on the Groups page]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/community/groups).

All our work is guided by our [Code of Conduct]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/event/conduct/).

## About the IIIF Consortium

IIIF is supported by a membership [consortium]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/community/consortium), with members from all over the world including Stanford University, Europeana, Kansai University, and many more.

You can [join the consortium]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/community/consortium/join/) as a _full_ or _associate member_. Consortium members can access customized training, and have voting rights on the overall direction of the framework via the [Technical Review Committee]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/community/trc/) or [Executive Committee]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/community/consortium/consortium_committees/#executive-committee). The consortium has [staff]({{ site.root_url | absolute_url }}/community/consortium/staff), who are stewards looking after the community, organizing events and training, and helping things run smoothly.


## The Editorial Committee

The IIIF Editorial Committee meets regularly and works in collaboration with [Community and Technical Specification Groups](/community/groups) to propose new technical specifications and to update existing ones. Learn about their work and current membership [on the Editors page][editors].

## IIIF Ambassadors
IIIF Ambassadors are deputized to work with Consortium staff to take a formal role in championing IIIF adoption in their communities. Ambassadors focus their efforts around different domains, associations, tools, or regions. Learn more about [the program and meet the current Ambassadors][ambassadors].
