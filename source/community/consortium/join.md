We rely on IIIF Consortium (IIIF-C) members to provide leadership and sustainability in support of our shared goals:

*   Providing researchers--and other audiences--an unprecedented level of uniform and rich access to digitized image, audio, and video resources hosted around the world
*   Defining and maintaining a community-driven set of APIs that support interoperability between repositories
*   Developing, cultivating, and documenting shared technologies that provide a world-class user experience in viewing, comparing, manipulating, and annotating digitized image, audio, and video resources.

**Becoming a member allows institutions to:**



*   Shape the IIIF agenda and drive the development roadmap for an open, international standard
*   Fund IIIFâ€™s supporting staff, who steward strategy, training, communications, infrastructure, outreach, growth, community-building, and adoption
*   Join a community of forward-thinking global technology leaders
*   Access discounted training
*   Receive reduced-price tickets to the IIIF Annual Conference
