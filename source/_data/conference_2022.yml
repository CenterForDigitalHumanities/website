    title: State of the IIIF Universe
    type: Presentation
  - abstract: With growing, global efforts for further establishing IIIF use for 2D
      images and Audio/Video (A/V) data, there is increasing commitment to develop
      similar standards for 3D content. The IIIF 3D Community Group is collaboratively
      considering common challenges and potential solutions with major 3D developers
      and researchers, and has formed the IIIF 3D Technical Specification Group, engaging
      even more widely with specialists and representatives across user communities
      and standards bodies. The complementary work of the CG and TSG is considering
      ways not only to suitably extend IIIF into the 3rd (physical) dimension, but
      also to explore digital opportunities to try to address the concerns of decolonisation
      and digital/object repatriation. In addition, the group will be considering
      creative options to support incorporation of 2D and A/V with 3D data, enabling
      combinations to form digital dioramas, scene and soundscape reconstructions,
      and the potential to help build an inclusive metaverse. Please do join us!

  - abstract: "Why a new Manifest Editor?<br/><br/>As the use of IIIF grows, so the\
      \ need for IIIF content creation tools grows.<br/><br/>Most IIIF manifests are\
      \ expected to produce consistent results in standard IIIF viewers.<br/><br/>But\
      \ increasingly, manifests are also being created for very specific user interfaces.\
      \ An early example is Wellcome Collection\u2019s Sleep Stories [1], from 2016.\
      \ In 2017, Digirati worked on IIIF Manifest-driven narratives for the V&A [2],\
      \ and in 2018 for Technical University, Delft.[3]<br/><br/>This work produced\
      \ a IIIF Manifest Editor [4] that in normal, default mode produces IIIF Presentation\
      \ 3 Manifests, but can be extended with plugins to produce IIIF Manifests with\
      \ particular structures and custom behavior properties, to drive bespoke viewing\
      \ experiences - slideshows, guided viewing and the complex digital exhibition\
      \ layouts seen in the Delft examples.<br/><br/>Now, in partnership with the\
      \ UK Towards a National Collection project [5] and Delft University of Technology\
      \ Library, we are building a new Manifest Editor framework, that can accommodate\
      \ many of the use cases we have seen emerging over the last 6 years.<br/><br/>This\
      \ aims to provide a general purpose tool that is:<br/>- Suitable for creating\
      \ general purpose manifests<br/>- Great for learning IIIF concepts<br/>- Configurable\
      \ to create manifests for specific target environments<br/>- Easily integrated\

  - abstract: "The benefits of IIIF for Digital Humanities (DH) scholarship are well\
      \ known: accessibility to images, metadata and annotation possibilities, and\
      \ ample visual display options. However, whilst the cultural heritage sector\
      \ and DH research centers have broadly adopted IIIF, its integration into teaching\
      \ practices has remained rather limited. At the same time, DH scholars are calling\
      \ for more extensive adoption of their field within Humanities scholarship.\
      \ Teaching DH requires a hybrid approach covering various digital tools to assist\
      \ research, educational, and science communication purposes, which is often\
      \ accompanied by underscoring the usefulness, openness, diversity, and collaboration-possibilities\
      \ of the tools in question (Batterhill & Ross, 2017). Rather than learn a fixed\
      \ set of computational hard skills, students need to contextualize digital technologies,\
      \ adopt a tool-critical attitude and apply them to a domain-specific context\
      \ (Armaselu, 2021; Kuhn, 2019).<br/><br/>IIIF is therefore a common denominator\
      \ in Ghent Centre For Digital Humanities\u2019 educational innovation project\
      \ to structurally embed DH and sustainably enhance digital competences within\
      \ the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy, including teacher education. Not only\
      \ does IIIF\u2019s flexibility and compliance with various DH applications greatly\
      \ assist a provisioned hybrid approach of teaching, but the open image-standard\
      \ also \u2018stitches together technology\u2019 for DH overall (Emanuel, 2018).\
      \ This presentation, which is based on various classroom-case studies, focus\
      \ group discussions, and questionnaires, explores how IIIF helped foster a shared\
      \ faculty-wide framework for basic and advanced digital competences of students,\
      \ (prospective) teachers, and faculty staff. Ranging from teacher education\
      \ to art history and Lingala language, diverse courses found common ground in\
      \ IIIF and compatible tools, such as Madoc, Omeka S, Storiiies and Exhibit.so.\
      \ Blended learning modules that combined workshops, video tutorials, manuals,\
      \ best practices, and literature provided assistance during the courses. This\
      \ presentation discusses how IIIF allowed teachers and students to relate DH\
      \ to their domain-specific knowledge, and how this resulted in a more widespread\
      \ integration of both IIIF and DH across Ghent University. "

  - abstract: "Many institutions have both:<br/><br/>1. transcripts for manuscripts\
      \ or printed books, encoded as TEI-XML<br/><br/>2. digital surrogates for those\
      \ same manuscripts or printed books, provided as IIIF<br/><br/>In ideal world,\
      \ it would be possible to display IIIF and TEI-XML side by side in the same\
      \ discovery environment, using a shared model for document structure to drive\
      \ navigation for both IIIF and TEI-XML, so that users, can, for example, compare\
      \ different witnesses to the same passage of text or read text and view images\
      \ together. However, IIIF surrogates and TEI-XML encoded texts have often been\
      \ created at different times, by different teams, as part of different workflows\
      \ and there may not be identifiers shared across both data models that facilitate\
      \ machine linking between text and image. In the absence of machine methods\
      \ for linking, manually linking text with image is often a labour intensive\
      \ process which requires expert knowledge of IIIF, or TEI-XML, or both. In this\
      \ presentation, I will present one approach to resolving this problem, in which\
      \ TEI-XML is used as the source of truth for text and document structure, and\
      \ this text and document structure is fed\u2014via a machine readable API\u2014\
      into a crowdsourcing environment in which expert users can link text, document\
      \ structure and IIIF resources together without knowing anything about the underlying\
      \ IIIF or TEI representations of the manuscript(s) in question. The eventual\
      \ output of this process is discoverable via the IIIF Change Discovery API,\
      \ and transformed into manifests with valid IIIF Ranges that reflect the underlying\
      \ structure of theTEI-XML and which can be used to:<br/><br/>* find all of the\
      \ witnesses to a particular text<br/><br/>* navigate directly to a particular\
      \ section of one or more manuscripts<br/><br/>* display text and image side-by-side<br/><br/>I\

      \ environment that can be used to search and browse texts and images together.<br/><br/>"

    type: Presentation
  - abstract: "In Spring 2022, a group of Harvard-based medievalists collaboratively\
      \ transcribed and prepared a digital edition of Houghton Library MS Lat. 5,\
      \ a thirteenth-century manuscript containing a copy of Conrad of Saxony\u2019\
      s Commentary on the Holy Places. Undertaken as part of a Harvard paleography\
      \ course, the collaborative transcription and editing of Conrad\u2019s Commentary\
      \ relied principally on the IIIF-compliant images that were first created, then\
      \ cataloged, and now housed at the institution\u2019s library. To allow for\
      \ group transcription, course instructor Sean Gilsdorf worked with Harvard librarian\
      \ Sara Powell to upload the IIIF-compliant images to Houghton Library\u2019\
      s account in FromThePage, a crowdsourcing platform that easily integrates IIIF\
      \ images into a collaborative transcription interface. Once the project participants\
      \ had completed the transcription following protocols developed by project consultant\
      \ Laura Morreale, the data was exported and then prepared for online editing\
      \ and publication at a subsequent workshop with Sarah Lang (University of Graz).<br/><br/>Since\
      \ this intense study of Houghton MS Lat. 5 was undertaken entirely within the\
      \ Harvard environment, and interoperability is a key feature of the IIIF system,\
      \ project participants were eager to share their work and make their new edition\
      \ of the Commentary available to the manuscript\u2019s future users. Despite\
      \ the local nature of all the resources used to complete the project, however,\
      \ common workflows do not yet exist within the Harvard ecosystem to complete\
      \ the \u201Cvirtuous circle\u201D\u2014that is, to return the annotations on\
      \ the text back to the cache of IIIF-compliant images that accompany the manuscript\
      \ description in the library catalog. This is neither surprising nor unexpected:\
      \ the full range of IIIF capabilities has yet to be understood, much less exploited,\
      \ by researchers who depend upon the technology for their work.<br/><br/>The\
      \ 2022 IIIF Conference offers a valuable opportunity not simply to present this\
      \ IIIF use case, but to discuss it and brainstorm solutions among members of\
      \ the IIIF community gathered on the Harvard campus. We propose a talk describing\
      \ this Harvard IIIF-based project, including the perspectives of the project\
      \ leaders and the Harvard librarians who facilitated the work, followed by a\
      \ \u201Cbirds of a feather\u201D session for conference participants working\
      \ at the intersection of IIIF technology and archival studies. This latter session\
      \ will solicit discussion of the problems and opportunities raised by this particular\
      \ case study, and ways to address them drawn from the session participants\u2019\
      \ own work. Our main goal is to determine how projects like ours might be brought\
      \ into a productive relationship with the resources that generated them, what\
      \ the IIIF \u201Cvirtuous cycle\u201D will actually look like, and how it could\
      \ be accomplished in cooperation with other stakeholders on campus. More broadly,\
      \ we hope that the work done with Houghton MS Lat. 5 can serve as a model for\
      \ other institutions and researchers engaged in similar projects using IIIF\
      \ images and tools.<br/><br/>"

  - abstract: "Gent Gemapt (2020-2023) is a public history pilot project that relies\
      \ on IIIF for the integration, presentation, and participative enrichment of\
      \ heritage. The premise of Gent Gemapt is that all types of heritage can be\
      \ mapped and that place is an ideal concept to structure and discover a city\u2019\
      s history. Gent Gemapt aims to merge heritage collections with historical maps\
      \ in order to connect collections, the urban landscape, and the people of Ghent.<br/><br/>Since\
      \ archival and heritage collections are often fragmented over different GLAMs,\
      \ we need a consistent way to organise the data. To do this spatially, we create\
      \ a geographical index - a gazetteer - which uniquely describes each place (e.g.\
      \ streets, squares, bodies of water, public buildings) with an identifier and\
      \ additional information. Additionally, IIIF provides a framework to unify collections\
      \ across GLAMs.<br/><br/>In Gent Gemapt, the heritage partners have diverging\
      \ digital infrastructures, metadata schemes and levels of IIIF implementation,\
      \ which complicates the extraction of common properties such as dates, references\
      \ to places, identifiers, coordinates etc. For each contributing partner, we\
      \ add a metadata mapping service to solve this issue.<br/><br/>We use Omeka\
      \ S as the framework to integrate the gazetteer, the collection data and the\
      \ historical maps. Places and manifests of collection objects are loaded into\
      \ Omeka S as items and referenced to each other. Historical maps are georeferenced,\
      \ converted to tile services and added as Omeka items. An API is built on top\
      \ of Omeka S to feed a rich user interface where users can navigate through\
      \ the historical map layers, query the places and explore the collections in\
      \ IIIF.<br/><br/>The next step for Gent Gemapt is to use the Madoc platform\
      \ to evolve from a presentation platform to a participative one where Ghentians\
      \ can enrich the location-based collections by enriching metadata, annotating\
      \ images, transcribing documents, and georeferencing historical maps. Next to\
      \ presenting the enriched collections in Gent Gemapt, a future challenge will\
      \ be to let the enriched collections be received and validated by the collection\
      \ managers as well.<br/><br/>"

  - abstract: Paul Laurence Dunbar was the first African-American poet to garner national
      critical acclaim. Born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1872, Dunbar penned a large body
      of dialect poems, standard English poems, essays, novels, and short stories
      before he died at the age of 33. His work often addressed the difficulties encountered
      by members of his race and the efforts of African-Americans to achieve equality
      in America. He was praised both by the prominent literary critics of his time
      and his literary contemporaries but the resources related to his works and life
      are often included in minority author exhibitions, aggregated genre-based collections,
      or disregarded altogether. The Dunbar Library and Archive (DLA) joins existing
      remote IIIF collections of images, manuscripts, scores, and performances with
      textual resources, geographic locations, and bibliographic records. In addition
      to enriching descriptions and relationships with new annotations, new authority
      entities are being created for the supporting people, places, and events surrounding
      his life. Students and community members are coordinating with the U.S. National
      Parks Service and community groups to digitize many artifacts and resources
      that are challenging to access. The University of Dayton offers a model for
      a focused and distributed open archive that offers better representation of
      the subject and his diverse communities, functions as a research portal for
      scholars and journalists, and encourages sharing and creation among teachers
      and members of the public. The team at Saint Louis University is building this
      data entry platform and public website as a reusable architecture on open and
      available tools including their TPEN transcription tool, public RERUM repository,
      as well as IIIF and W3C Web Annotation standards. The first phase of this project
      completes this August and the public site development continues through June
      2023.

    title: Restoring a Space for Paul Dunbar
    type: Presentation
  - abstract: Mapping Color in History (MCH) is a digital humanities project which
      examines scientific data drawn from material analyses of pigments in Asian paintings
      from a historical perspective. Existing pigment databases and publications are
      centered around the pigment and are difficult to use for non-specialists. MCH
      builds on this pigment and element data which has been collected by art conservation
      scientists during XRF, infrared, and Raman forensic analyses, but makes it easier
      for art history researchers to use the data. MCH also goes further than existing
      pigment databases by foregrounding the historical objects and presenting scientific
      pigment data in that context. Each work in the platform includes extensive bibliographic
      and art history metadata. This facilitates geospatial and temporal analyses,
      such as tracking where and when pigments first became available to artists by
      plotting their appearances on maps and timelines.<br/><br/>The visual display
      of information is central to Mapping Color in History. IIIF is a natural technology
      to use for a project which relies on visual works from numerous museum and library
      digital collections. Some institutions, such as the Harvard Art Museums, already
      provide resources via IIIF, and these were easy to integrate into MCH. However,
      many other institutions do not yet provide IIIF resources. MCH utilizes a new
      IIIF ingest pipeline provided by the Harvard Library Technical Services team
      (LTS) which provides image servers and infrastructure as a service to numerous
      university clients. This centralized IIIF infrastructure allows new projects
      across the university to integrate IIIF rapidly while staying focused on application
      features rather than IIIF-specific implementation details and maintenance. Our
      process starts by securing image rights from a holding institution and obtaining
      high resolution files. Mapping Color researchers provide the image files and
      associated metadata. The MCH application deposits the images in an S3 bucket,
      generates a manifest, validates the manifest, and submits an ingest request
      to the LTS ingest service via JSON endpoint with JWT authentication. The ingest
      service then creates and activates URNs for the manifest and all referenced
      assets and serves images and manifests.<br/><br/>IIIF also allows us to deeply
      integrate pigment analysis data with the object digital representations. Mapping
      Color in History uses a CatchPy annotation server, which allows researchers
      to annotate analyses as layers on a canvas representing the work. We have extended
      the Mirador 3 mirador-annotations plugin to include an adapter for CatchPy and
      to allow researchers to also capture the visible color and analysis methodology
      associated with each annotation point. This links the annotations back to our
      application data, so end users can click on a visible color and have it highlighted
      within Mirador. The UX is much more usable for researchers and casual users
      than typical pigment databases, as it is easy to see exactly where pigments
      appear on the work and compare analyses of different paintings.

  - abstract: "Miiify is an experimental annotation server that is based on the W3C\
      \ Web Annotation Protocol. Rather than rely on running a centralised infrastructure,\
      \ Miiify adopts a distributed approach to collaboration using a peer review\
      \ process facilitated on GitHub. Each user interacts with their own instance\
      \ of Miiify using a web interface that supports annotating content such as images.\
      \ Contributions are then submitted back to the main GitHub repository through\
      \ a pull request.<br/><br/>Miiify is built using Irmin, a distributed database\
      \ technology following the same principles as Git. Some key features of Miiify\
      \ include:<br/><br/>\u2022 Native Git support (no external database required)<br/><br/>\u2022\
      \ No requirement to support user authentication or accounts<br/><br/>\u2022\
      \ Provenance through Git commit history<br/><br/>\u2022 Light-weight (Docker\
      \ image less than 60MB)<br/><br/>The ability to read and write data in the Git\
      \ format means that there is no dependency on an external database technology.\
      \ The contents of the Git repository (the annotations) can be navigated as a\
      \ tree structure corresponding directly to the structure of the JSON. Running\
      \ a dedicated centralised crowdsourcing service requires user account management.\
      \ This will include governing what privileges users have to alter data on that\
      \ platform. Using Git means we can take advantage of the identity management\
      \ available in platforms such as GitHub. GitHub conforms to GDPR regulations\
      \ by limiting the amount of personal data required to use the service. For example,\
      \ to contribute on GitHub only a valid email address is required which can provide\
      \ a level of anonymity for a user. However, any changes to data made by users\
      \ are visible through the review process these platforms facilitate. The complete\
      \ history of changes are maintained which allows data to be reverted to any\
      \ known previous version. Miiify has been built with the OCaml toolchain which\
      \ compiles to efficient native code capable of running within a light-weight\
      \ Docker container or even within a unikernel directly on a hypervisor or bare\
      \ metal."

      platform (https://collections.snm.ku.dk/en) both researchers and members of
      the general public can explore the collections in intimate detail from anywhere
      in the world. There are hundreds of thousands of objects to explore with more
      being added frequently by the museum.<br/><br/>In this lightning talk I will
      explain how the collection weaves together images and metadata from the museum's
      in-house collection management system and the Global Biodiversity Information

  - abstract: pdiiif allows users to generate a PDF with a table of contents, a hidden
      text layer (if the manifest has OCR) and, optionally, annotations from any IIIF
      manifest. Where possible, this is done using their web browser for the bulk
      of the work. Compared to other solutions, it is very memory efficient by using
      a streaming approach that never keeps more than a few pages in memory at once
      (depending on the browser). Plans for the future include a way to re-import
      annotations applied to the PDF (e.g. done on an iPad) back into WebAnnotations
      to bridge the gap between online and offline workflows. At the moment, pdiiif
      is available as a standalone web application and as a low-footprint JavaScript
      library that can be embedded in other applications. A Mirador 3 plugin and browser
      extensions are planned for later in 2022.

  - abstract: The Swiss National Data & Service Center for the Humanities (DaSCH),
      a IIIF-C full member since 2017 has implemented the Simple Image Presentation
      Interface (SIPI), a IIIF Image API 3.0 Server that DaSCH maintained with the
      help of the Digital Humanities Lab of the University of Basel, within the DaSCH
      Service Platform (DSP), a software framework used for storing, sharing, and
      working with primary sources and data in the humanities.<br/><br/>DaSCH is in
      the process of designing a proof-of-concept for the deployment of the IIIF Presentation
      API 3.0 and the IIIF Change Discovery API 1.0, on the basis of the existing
      resources and projects hosted on DSP. For the Presentation API, templates will
      be first created manually with the help of the cookbook recipes. Then, scripts
      enabling the semi-automation for generating IIIF resources will be designed.
      As for the Change Discovery, DaSCH already provides an Event log of created
      resources. Thus an assessment on how the ActivityStreams endpoint could be built
      on top of it will be carried out.<br/><br/>The lightning talk will explore the
      process and challenges involved in deploying these IIIF APIs and how they could
      be implemented within DSP to allow users to further contextualise cultural heritage
      resources on and off the platform as well as enabling improved aggregation thereof.<br/><br/>

  - abstract: IIIF has been developing now for over 10 years, evolving from a collaborative
      method for presenting images on the web into a robust, well documented, global
      framework for sharing and linking images, annotations, video, audio, and soon,
      hopefully, even 3D models. So it seems about time to start to consider, at what
      stage might IIIF transition into the International Information Interoperability
      Framework? This lighting talk will introduce a new simple IIIF Collection and
      Manifest presentation tool, based around Mirador 3, which uses the existing
      presentation API to link sets of images to PDF versions of related publications,
      but also explores how the presentation API could be used, or potentially, extended
      to share further data sets and also support the presentation of simple interactive
      tables or even graphs. Pushing even further the idea that the documented structure
      for IIIF could be reused or extended to share additional types of data and demonstrate
      a working example of why it could be time to swap "Image" for "Information".

  - abstract: "Starting with version 7.2 DSpace, provides basic support for IIIF out\
      \ of box. The work was the result of a joint effort between Willamette University\
      \ and 4Science. Willamette University had begun work on DSpace version 7 and\
      \ IIIF as a way to enhance access to digital content that was being hosted on\
      \ two local systems. A key objective was to replace this existing infrastructure\

  - abstract: As a result of the IIIF Presentation API version 3 (henceforth, IIIFv3),
      we've gotten a set of rules for annotating video. However, there is still not
      enough implementation to treat it easily. Under such situation, Mirador version
      3 finally implements the ability to show video. Therefore, we started to develop
      a function to embed annotations to Mirador version 3's video. As a result, not
      only text but also images can be pasted on the video only by writing a JSON
      file compliant with IIIFv3. This also means that you can re-edit a video that
      has already been published. In addition, we have improved the subtitle display
      for ELAN's WebVTT. This allowed us to improve the interoperability of Video
      through IIIF.

  - abstract: Art exhibition catalogs provide documentation for items displayed during
      an exhibition at museums or art galleries. The contents of these catalogs are
      important for GLAM institutions, as many of the works described in these catalogs
      are now part of their collections. Moreover, art historians use these catalogs
      to research the exposition of works, investigate particular curators, galleries,
      artists, and discover general trends over time. Even though a large portion
      of the catalogs have been digitized, their contents are not transcribed, making
      automated processes such as full-text search difficult. And although there exist
      several end-to-end Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems which can automate
      the transcription process, these often require technical knowledge for the selection
      of pre- and post-processing methods or retraining of the underlying OCR model.
      Thus the use of these sources remains a largely manual and time-intensive task.<br/><br/>During
      this talk, I will present a semi-automated pipeline which is able to extract
      metadata from exhibition catalogs. I investigate this using 19th-century art
      exhibition catalogs of - predominantly Flemish - fine arts museums. This is
      done by implementing a general OCR model (Tesseract OCR) which is adapted to
      the characteristics of the art catalogs. The OCR text output is then transformed
      into IIIF annotations, which can be loaded as part of a IIIF manifest into Madoc
      - an open source, IIIF-based platform for (participatory) annotation, transcription
      and showcasing of digital collections. In Madoc, the OCR results can be further
      corrected by volunteers or domain experts. Afterward, the corrected text data
      is datamined using machine learning techniques such as Named Entity Recognition
      (NER) and Document Layout Analysis. The extracted keywords are then linked to
      external authorities such as RKD Artists and Art and Architecture Thesaurus
      (AAT). Finally, this linked information is embedded in the IIIF manifest. This
      method assists in reusing, sharing and querying the extracted information without
      requiring a heavy technical background. Thanks to this enriched Linked Open
      Data, art historians will be able to compile exhibition timelines for artworks
      and discover previously unknown patterns between artworks based on their exhibition
      history.

      \ could serve as a means to make accessible and share research data, which could\
      \ ultimately lead to a more open scholarly practice surrounding the whole data\

      \ IIIF tools have to be integrated better in order to serve a possibly seamless\
      \ user experience as well as to support scholars in \u201Cgetting-the-job-done\u201D\
      . Secondly, among humanities scholars, there might be a lack of awareness of\
      \ the potentials of IIIF tools which might derive from relatively high technical\
      \ barriers with little benefit for users having only little or no technical\

      \ Zentralbibliothek Z\xFCrich (Central Library Zurich) was only recently founded\
      \ with the goal to make our digital assets more accessible and usable for a\
      \ wider audience. With its dual role as public and research library, the ZB\
      \ Zurich wants to address respective user groups equally, hoping to bring forward\
      \ the digital turn in a user-friendly way whilst benefiting from higher user\
      \ interaction. The main function of the ZB-Lab therefore is to search, find,\
      \ and create digital service solutions that take into account the potential\
      \ of the ZB\u2019s digital assets as well as its user needs.<br/><br/>"

  - abstract: "Avalon Media System is an open source system for managing and providing\
      \ access to collections of digital audio and video based on the Samvera technology\
      \ stack. In use at over a dozen institutions, IIIF support has become an important\
      \ part of Avalon\u2019s strategy for the presentation of digital media assets\
      \ and interoperability with other digital repository systems. To this end, IIIF\
      \ APIs have become key players across components within the application.<br/><br/>In\
      \ this session we will share an overview of IIIF integration and usage across\
      \ software developed by and with the Avalon team. This includes IIIF Presentation\
      \ 3 manifest generation for digital objects in Avalon Media System; development\
      \ on the IIIF Timeliner tool and its integration into Avalon; a new video player\
      \ designed for rich presentation of IIIF Presentation 3 manifests, built using\
      \ React and Video.js; and contributions to community cookbook recipes and use\
      \ cases for IIIF APIs."

  - abstract: "Since 2018, the Indiana University (IU) Libraries have been working\
      \ with partners at AVP, New York Public Library (NYPL), and the University of\
      \ Texas at Austin, with support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, to build\
      \ the Audiovisual Metadata Platform, or AMP. AMP is an open-source software\
      \ platform that allows archivists and librarians to define and execute custom\
      \ workflows that combine artificial intelligence and machine learning services\
      \ with human expertise in order to more efficiently and effectively create metadata\
      \ in support of discovery, identification, navigation, and rights determination.\
      \ One of the features of AMP is the ability for implementers to add their own\
      \ \u201Cadapters,\u201D which could be additional machine learning tools or\
      \ data output generators that map from AMPs internal JSON schema to another\
      \ data format, such as IIIF. In this session, we will share an overview of the\
      \ AMP platform, illustrate potential use cases for implementation, demonstrate\
      \ the use of the Avalon project\u2019s IIIF-based Timeliner tool for output\
      \ correction, and discuss the potential of AMP for exporting machine learning\
      \ annotations as IIIF manifests for use in emerging audiovisual platforms and\
      \ players that support the IIIF Annotation format, such as AudiAnnotate and\
      \ Aviary."

  - abstract: "Digital collection front ends tend to lean on the \u201Cviewer\u201D\
      \ as the primary and sometimes only way for a user to interact with a IIIF manifest.\
      \ This overview will dive into how we are seeking to make more modular our implementation\
      \ of the IIIF Presentation 3.0 API with works, collections, and the web sites\
      \ that showcase them. Our approach has led us to create more modular IIIF viewing\
      \ tools such as Clover (a Manifest items tool), Bloom (a Collection items tool),\
      \ and Nectar (a IIIF descriptive property primitive library) that extend the\
      \ idea of a client and viewer.<br/><br/>Tools to be discussed:<br/><br/>https://github.com/samvera-labs/clover-iiif<br/><br/>https://github.com/samvera-labs/bloom-iiif<br/><br/>https://github.com/samvera-labs/nectar-iiif"
